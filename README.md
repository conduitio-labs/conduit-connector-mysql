# Conduit Connector for MySQL

<!-- readmegen:description -->
## Source

A source connector pulls data from an external resource and pushes it to
downstream resources via Conduit.

### Snapshot mode

Snapshot mode is the first stage of the source sync process. It reads all rows
from the configured tables as record snapshots.

In snapshot mode, the record payload consists of
[opencdc.StructuredData](https://conduit.io/docs/using/opencdc-record#structured-data),
with each key being a column and each value being that column's value.

### Change Data Capture mode

When the connector switches to CDC mode, it starts streaming changes from the
obtained position at the start of the snapshot. It uses the row-based binlog format
to capture detailed changes at the individual row level.

### Unsafe snapshot

By default, the connector will error out if it finds a table that has no primary key and no specified sorting column specified, as we can't guarantee that the snapshot will be consistent. Table changes during the snapshot will be however captured by CDC mode.

As of writing, the unsafe snapshot is implemented using batches with `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`, so expect it to be slow for large tables. You can optimize the snapshot by specifying a sorting column (see source configuration parameters).
The position of the table is currently not recorded, so the unsafe snapshot will restart from zero every time.

### Schema

The source connector uses [avro](https://avro.apache.org/docs/1.11.1/specification/) to decode mysql rows. Here's the MySQL datatype to avro datatype equivalence that the connector uses:

| MySQL Type | Avro Type |
| ---------- | --------- |
| TINYINT    | int       |
| SMALLINT   | int       |
| MEDIUMINT  | int       |
| INT        | int       |
| BIGINT     | long      |
| DECIMAL    | double    |
| NUMERIC    | double    |
| FLOAT      | double    |
| DOUBLE     | double    |
| BIT        | bytes     |
| CHAR       | string    |
| VARCHAR    | string    |
| TINYTEXT   | string    |
| TEXT       | string    |
| MEDIUMTEXT | string    |
| LONGTEXT   | string    |
| BINARY     | bytes     |
| VARBINARY  | bytes     |
| TINYBLOB   | bytes     |
| BLOB       | bytes     |
| MEDIUMBLOB | bytes     |
| LONGBLOB   | bytes     |
| DATE       | string    |
| TIME       | string    |
| DATETIME   | string    |
| TIMESTAMP  | string    |
| YEAR       | long      |
| ENUM       | string    |
| SET        | string    |
| JSON       | string    |

## Destination

The MySQL destination takes a slice of `opencdc.Record` and writes them in batches to MySQL. It will use the `opencdc.collection` field in the metadata to determine the table to write to.

### Upsert Behavior

If the target table contains a column with a unique constraint (this includes PRIMARY KEY and UNIQUE indexes), records will be upserted. Otherwise, they will be appended. Support for updating tables without unique constraints is tracked [here](https://github.com/conduitio-labs/conduit-connector-mysql/issues/66).

If the target table already contains a record with the same key, the Destination will upsert with its current received values. Because Keys must be unique, this can overwrite and thus potentially lose data, so keys should be assigned correctly from the Source.

If a unique key is not present in the target table, the record will be simply appended.

## Requirements and compatibility

The connector is tested against MySQL v8.0. Compatibility with older versions isn't guaranteed.

### MySQL Server Requirements:

- Binary Log (binlog) must be enabled.
- Binlog format must be set to ROW.
- Binlog row image must be set to FULL.
- Tables must have **sortable** primary keys.

### MySQL User Privileges:

For Snapshot and CDC modes, the following privileges are required:

- SELECT
- LOCK TABLES
- RELOAD
- REPLICATION CLIENT
- REPLICATION SLAVE

          # Tables represents the tables to read from. - By default, no tables

          # provided, so the final regex supersedes all previous ones. - To
          # include all tables, use "*". You can then filter that list by adding
          # a comma-separated string of regex patterns. - To set an "include"
          # regex, add "+" or nothing in front of the regex. - To set an
          # "exclude" regex, add "-" in front of the regex. - e.g. "-.*meta$,

## Testing

Run `make test` to run all tests.

The Docker compose file at `test/docker-compose.yml` can be used to run the required resource locally. It includes [adminer](https://www.adminer.org/) for database management.

Use the `TRACE=true` environment variable to enable trace logs when running tests.
